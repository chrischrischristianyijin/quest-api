# Digest Email Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
The weekly digest emails were successfully sent using Brevo templates, but the "本周收藏" (This Week's Collection) and "AI总结" (AI Summary) sections were showing placeholder text instead of actual content.

## Root Cause
The `build_user_digest_payload()` method in `digest_content.py` was missing the AI summary and insights sections that the Brevo template expected.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/app/services/digest_content.py`

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Added `ai_summary` field to payload for "AI总结" section
- ✅ Added `sections.tags` field to payload for "本周收藏" section  
- ✅ Created new `_create_insights_by_tags_section()` method
- ✅ Integrated insights organization by tags

**New Payload Structure:**
```python
payload = {
    "user": {...},
    "activity_summary": {...},
    "sections": {
        "highlights": {...},
        "more_content": {...},
        "stacks": {...},
        "suggestions": {...},
        "tags": [...]  # NEW: For "本周收藏" section
    },
    "ai_summary": "...",  # NEW: For "AI总结" section
    "metadata": {...}
}
```

### 2. `/app/services/digest_job.py`

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Added AI summary generation after payload creation
- ✅ Integrated `repo.get_ai_summary()` call with user_id
- ✅ Added error handling for AI summary generation
- ✅ Added fallback messages for no insights scenarios

**New Flow:**
1. Get user activity (insights, stacks)
2. Build digest payload
3. **NEW:** Generate AI summary if insights available
4. **NEW:** Update payload with AI summary
5. Send email via Brevo template

## What This Fixes

### ✅ "本周收藏" (This Week's Collection) Section
- **Before:** Showed placeholder text "本周暂无打过标签的收藏"
- **After:** Shows actual insights organized by tags with format:
  ```
  Tag Name: Article 1, Article 2, Article 3...
  ```

### ✅ "AI总结" (AI Summary) Section  
- **Before:** Showed placeholder text "你的脑图/文字总结将生成后显示在此处"
- **After:** Shows AI-generated summary of weekly insights using ChatGPT API

## Data Flow Now Working

1. **Database Retrieval** ✅ - `digest_repo.py` fetches insights with tags
2. **AI Summary Generation** ✅ - `ai_summary_service.py` generates summaries
3. **Tag Organization** ✅ - `digest_content.py` organizes insights by tags
4. **Payload Building** ✅ - Both sections now included in payload
5. **Email Sending** ✅ - Brevo template receives complete data

## Expected Result

Your weekly digest emails will now display:
- ✅ **Actual insights organized by tags** in the "本周收藏" section
- ✅ **AI-generated summaries** in the "AI总结" section  
- ✅ **Proper Chinese localization** from your Brevo template
- ✅ **Complete content** instead of placeholder text

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Deploy the updated code
2. Trigger a digest email: 
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://quest-api-edz1.onrender.com/api/v1/email/cron/digest?force=true" \
        -H "X-Cron-Secret: qylpgqjH8m5G6vOm7dOs2d0xR0CzMZ1YebRcgjuFK-0"
   ```
3. Check that the email shows actual content instead of placeholders

## Files That Were Already Working
- ✅ `/app/services/digest_repo.py` - Database operations
- ✅ `/app/services/ai_summary_service.py` - AI summary generation  
- ✅ `/app/services/email_sender.py` - Email sending via Brevo
- ✅ `/app/services/webhook_handler.py` - Webhook handling

The issue was purely in the data structure preparation, not in the underlying services.
